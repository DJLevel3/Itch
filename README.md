# Itch
### Scratch that itch!

Itch is an audio plugin that allows for loading samples and scratching with them!
The controls are extremely simple and almost entirely interfaced with through automation, making it easy to save your work and replay it, and the plugin uses linear interpolation for time stretching, so it's perfect for oscilloscope music!

Based on my other sampler VST, [S3](https://github.com/DJLevel3/S3).
